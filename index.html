        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>

        <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
        
        <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <code>&lt;head></code>, <code>&lt;title></code>, <code>&lt;body></code>, <code>&lt;header></code>, <code>&lt;footer></code>, and many others.</p>
        
        <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">".  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <code>&lt;title></code> tag can be written as <code>&lt;Title></code>, <code>&lt;TITLE></code>, or in any other way.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Page_Structure">
        <header><h2>Page Structure</h2></header>
        <p>Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:</p>

        <h3>Header</h3>
        <p>Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading and/or logo. This is where the main common information about a website usually stays from one webpage to another.</p>
        
        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
        <p>Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having an inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than a individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.</p>

        <h3>Main Content</h3>
        <p>A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!</p>

        <h3>Sidebar</h3>
        <p>Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.</p>

        <h3>Footer</h3>
        <p>A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Accessibility">
        <header><h2>Accessibility</h2></header>
        <p>Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible — we traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but really it also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.</p>

        <p>You could also think of accessibility as treating everyone the same, and giving them the same opportunities, no matter what their ability or circumstances. In the same way that it is not right to exclude someone from a physical building because they are in a wheelchair (public buildings generally have wheelchair ramps or elevators these days), it is also not right to exclude someone from a website because they have a visual impairment. We are all different, but we are all human, and therefore have the same (human) rights.<p>

        <p>Accessibility is the right thing to do, but it is also part of the law in some countries, and it can open up some significant markets that otherwise wouldn't be able to use your services, buy your products, etc.</p>

        <p>Accessibility and the best practices it entails can benefit everyone:
          <ul>
            <li>Semantic HTML (which improves accessibility) also improves SEO, making your site more findable/marketable.</li>
            <li>Caring about accessibility demonstrates good ethics/morals, which improves your public image.</li>
            <li>Other good practices that improve accessibility also make your site more usable by other groups, such as mobile phone users, those on a low network speed, etc. In fact, everyone can benefit from many such improvements.</li>
            <li>Did we mention it is also the law in some places?</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="CSS">
        <header><h2>CSS</h2></header>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, how the browser turns HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM), how CSS is applied to parts of the DOM, some very basic syntax examples, and what code is used to actually include our CSS in our web page.</p>

        <p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to affect how they are displayed. A CSS rule is formed from:
          <ul>
            <li>A set of properties, which have values set to update how the HTML content is displayed, for example, I want my element's width to be 50% of its parent element, and its background to be red.</li>
            <li>A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, I want to apply my CSS rule to all the paragraphs in my HTML document.</li>
          </ul>
        A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. You will learn a lot more about what CSS syntax looks like in the next article of the module — CSS Syntax.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="How_the_Web_Works">
        <header><h2>How the Web Works</h2></header>
        <p>When you type a web address into your browser (for our analogy that's like walking to the shop):
          <ol>
            <li>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on (you find the address of the shop).</li>
            <li>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.</li>
            <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring them back to your house).</li>
            <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you (the goods arrive at your door — new shiny stuff, awesome!).</li>
          </ol>
